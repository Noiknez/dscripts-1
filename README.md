# dscripts
Hey there!
Here is a repository for some scripts I've made in dScripts (dScript is the scripting language of the Denizen plugin for Spigot).

Everyone is free to uses them in their server; either it is a public or private server. But please, it would be great considering giving me a credits and even a link to where you found the script to anyone asking about it.

Other than that, simply have fun with them. Don't hesitate to open an issue if you want to see a new feature added or if you found a problem on a script.

Thanks,
Vellric
