# dscripts
Hey there!
Here is a repository for some scripts I've made in dScripts (dScript is the scripting language of the Denizen plugin for Spigot : https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/denizen.21039/).

Before saying anything else, I want to thank some people that are part of thoses scripts I'll release. First one, the Denizen community on the IRC, in particular mcmonkey, |Anthony| and BlackCoyote. They have helped me from my Day 1 on the IRC and I've learned with their help. Also, a thanks to Morphan1 who also contribute to the Denizen developpement. The last thanks are for my friends, who have supported me throught that dAventures and in my crazy project that, I hope, will see the day light, someday.

Everyone is free to uses them in their server; either it is a public or private server. But please, it would be great considering giving me a credits and even a link to where you found the script to anyone asking about it.

Other than that, simply have fun with them. Don't hesitate to open an issue if you want to see a new feature added or if you found a problem on a script.

Thanks,
Vellric
