# dscripts
Hey there!
Here is a repository for some scripts I've made in dScripts (dScript is the scripting language of the Denizen plugin for Spigot : https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/denizen.21039/).

Before saying anything else, I want to thank some people that are part of the scripts I'll release. First one, the Denizen community on the IRC, particularly mcmonkey, |Anthony| and BlackCoyote. They have helped me from Day 1 and I've learned a lot with their help. Also, thanks to Morphan1 who also contributed to the Denizen developpement. The last thanks are for my friends, who have supported me throughout that dAventures and also in my crazy projects that, I hope, will see the light of day (someday).

It is free to use for anyone who wants to incorporate them in their server; in either a public or private server. Also, it would be a great help to consider giving me credits for my work and even put a link to where you found the script so anyone can use it without asking.

Other than that, simply have fun with them. Don't hesitate to open an issue if you want to see a new feature added or if you found a problem in a script.

Thanks,
Vellric
